README for ATM-OCN with transferred Grids between ATM and OCN Components
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.1.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  * Implements IPDv03 to accept Grids from OCN component.
                  * Indicates "cannot provide" for some Grids
                  * Indicates "can provide" for some Grids
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  * Implements IPDv01.
                  * Implicitly indicate "will provide" for all Grids.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for ATM
                  and OCN.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
