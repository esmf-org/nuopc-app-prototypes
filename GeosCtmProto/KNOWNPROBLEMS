1. The new grid factory code requires the following attributes in CTM's config
object:  GRID_TYPE and IM_WORLD.  These two values can be derived from the
GRIDNAME attribute (PE48x288-CF).  But, ESMF Config library does not support
adding a non-integer attribute such as "GRID_TYPE".  Also,
ESMF_ConfigSetAttribute somehow doesn't work properly when adding IM_WORLD.
So, I added GRID_TYPE and IM_WORLD into GEOSCTM.rc

2. In fvcore_layout.rc (the config file for AdvCore component), there are
attributes npx and npy.  In the earlier version of GEOSctm_lite, the values
are both 48, but the new code expected npy to be 6*npx.  So I changed it to
288.

3. Extdata export fields are mirrored from the import fields of CTM.  But, the
attributes of the fields are not copied when the fields are mirrored.  What it
is looking for includes:  PRECISION, STAGGERING, ROTATION

4. Extdata needs to know the value of NX and NY from its config.  But, NX and
NY are defined in GEOSCTM.rc, which is the ROOT_CF defined in CAP.rc.  I
currently set the config for the Extdata component to be CAP.rc.

5. The Makefile has to be changed to link with MAPL libraries in the
GEOSctm_lite directory.  The changes are:

MAPL_INSTALL_ROOT = /gpfsm/dnb31/pli/GEOSctm_lite/Linux
MAPL_INCDIR = $(MAPL_INSTALL_ROOT)/include
MAPL_INCLUDEPATHS = -I$(MAPL_INCDIR)/MAPL_cfio_r4 -I$(MAPL_INCDIR)/MAPL_Base -I$(MAPL_INCDIR)/FVdycoreCubed_GridComp -I$(MAPL_INCDIR)/fvdycore -I$(MAPL_INCDIR)/GFDL_fms -I$(NEWBASEDIR)/include/esmf
MAPL_LINKPATHS    = -L$(MAPL_INSTALL_ROOT)/lib 
MAPL_LINKLIBS     = -lMAPL_Base -lMAPL_cfio_r4 -lFVdycoreCubed_GridComp -lfvdycore -lGEOS_Shared -lGMAO_mpeu -lGFDL_fms

Also $(MAPL_LINKLIBS) has to come before $(ESMF_F90ESMFLINKLIBS) in the
linking process
