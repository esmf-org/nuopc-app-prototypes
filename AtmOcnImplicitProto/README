README for ATM-OCN with implicit coupling NUOPC prototype
---------------------------------------------------------

Show implicit coupling between two model components. The OCN processes are
slit into fast and slow. The ATM processes are all fast, but are split into
down and up sweep phases. The driver implements a two time scale run sequence
to correctly sequence the ATM and OCN run phases.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver and two model components.

  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the ATM, 
  and OCN components. 

  The ESM driver constructs a custom run sequence with two time scales to
  implement implicit coupling between ATM and OCN components: slow & fast
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  Both ATM and OCN components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model,
                  but don't use generic Run() routine.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model,
                  but don't use generic Run() routine.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
