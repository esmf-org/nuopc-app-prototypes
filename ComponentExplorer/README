README for the NUOPC Component Explorer
---------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Description:

    The NUOPC Component Explorer is a tool that allows a developer to gain
  insight into an ESMF component that abides by the NUOPC Layer rules. Currently
  the focus is on the advertised Fields in the import and export States. 
  
    There are two basic modes of operation of the Explorer:
  
  A) Exploring a component that provides a NUOPC standard makefile fragment:
     
     Step 1: Use the "nuopcExplorerScript" to build the "nuopcExplorerApp",
             supplying the component's makefile fragment as a command line
             argument:
             
             ./nuopcExplorerScript <component-mk-file>
             
             The "nuopcExplorerScript" analyzes the component's makefile
             fragment and prints relevant information to stdout. The last step
             of the script is to build the "nuopcExplorerApp" against the
             specified component.
             
     Step 2: Run the "nuopcExplorerApp" to analyze the component's run-time
             behavior. This may require running in a parallel environment:
             
             mpirun -np X ./nuopcExplorerApp
             (where X is the number of PETs)
             
             or it may be sufficient to run on a single PET:
             
             ./nuopcExplorerApp
             
             The details of execution depend on the specific system, as well as
             on component specifics.
             
             Explorer output is sent to stdout. Additional output may be 
             available in the PET*LogFile generated by ESMF.
             
  B) Exploring a component that is available in form of a shared object without
     hardcoding the name of the shared object into the explorer application:
     
     Step 1: Build the "nuopcExplorerApp" without referencing the component's
             makefile fragment:
             
             make nuopcExplorerApp
             
             This uses the same code as case A) to build the "nuopcExplorerApp", 
             however, the name of the shared object that holds the component
             code to be explored is not hardcoded into the application. The
             same "nuopcExplorerApp" can be used to explore different components
             in step 2.
             
     Step 2: Run the "nuopcExplorerApp" to analyze the component's run-time
             behavior by passing in the name of the component's shared object
             as a command line argument. This may require running in a parallel
             environment:
             
             mpirun -np X ./nuopcExplorerApp <component-shared-object-file>
             (where X is the number of PETs)
             
             or it may be sufficient to run on a single PET:
             
             ./nuopcExplorerApp <component-shared-object-file>
             
             The details of execution depend on the specific system, as well as
             on component specifics.
             
             Explorer output is sent to stdout. Additional output may be 
             available in the PET*LogFile generated by ESMF.
            
             The "nuopcExplorerApp" can be used to explore different components
             simply by specifying a different shared object file on the command
             line.
