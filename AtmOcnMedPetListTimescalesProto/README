README for ATM-OCN-MED with petList NUOPC prototype and two time scales
NUOPC prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Show how a Driver can setup a run sequence with two time scales, and the 
Mediator has slow and fast run phases.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM), two model components
  (ATM, OCN), and a mediator (MED).
  
  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the ATM, OCN,
  and MED components. 

  The ESM driver constructs a custom run sequence with two time scales to
  implement coupling between ATM, OCN, and MED components: slow & fast
  
  The MED component uses two clocks, and specializes two label_Advance phases:
  slow & fast
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  ATM, OCN, and MED components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - med.F90     - The Mediator component, specializing generic 
                  NUOPC_Mediator, implementing two Advance phases: slow & fast
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for
                  ATM, OCN, and MEDm; Set custom RunSequence with two 
                  timescales: slow interaction w/ OCN & fast interaction w/ ATM.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
