README for ATM-OCN-ICE with simple implicit coupling NUOPC prototype
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Show a simple implicit coupling between three model components. The OCN and
ICE components lag behind the ATM component and expect ATM fields at time t+dt
for their own forward step t -> t+dt.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver and three model components.

  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the ATM, OCN,
  and ICE components. 

  The ESM driver constructs a custom run sequence to introduce a time lag
  between the ATM component and the OCN + ICE components.
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  Both ATM, OCN, and ICE components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  -> expects ATM fields at t+dt for integration step t->t+dt
                  -> this is done by overwriting CheckImport by an
                     implicit version (checking for import Fields with future
                     timeStamp)
  - ice.F90     - The ICE component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  -> expects ATM fields at t+dt for integration step t->t+dt
                  -> this is done by overwriting CheckImport by an
                     implicit version (checking for import Fields with future
                     timeStamp)
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
