README for ATM-OCN NUOPC prototype with CplSet connections
----------------------------------------------------------

A simple two model system with multiple sets of coupled states.

Description

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM) and two model components
  (ATM, OCN).

  Three nested states are added to the import state and the export state of the
  ATM component.  The nested states are labeled Nest1, Nest2, and Nest3.
  The same set of fieldNames are added to each nested state.

  Two nested states are added to the import state and the export state of the
  OCN component.  The nested states are labeled Nest2 and Nest3.
  The same set of fieldNames are added to each nested state.

  The ATM-TO-OCN connector couples ATM:Nest2 to OCN:Nest2 and ATM:Nest3 to
  OCN:Nest3. ATM:Nest1 is not connected.

  The OCN-TO-ATM connector couples OCN:Nest2 to ATM:Nest2 and OCN:Nest3 to
  ATM:Nest3. ATM:Nest1 is not connected.

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.1.0r or later. CplSet connections were first added in
    ESMF_7_1_0_beta_snapshot_40
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
    X should not exceed 4 or the domain decomposition for Nest1 will fail.
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
