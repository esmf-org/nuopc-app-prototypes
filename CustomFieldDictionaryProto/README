README for Custom Field Dictionary NUOPC prototype
--------------------------------------------------

Very simple NUOPC app to demonstrate how to setup a custom NUOPC Field
dictionary from a NUOPC Field dictionary file in YAML format. 
This app consists of a Driver controlling a single Model component.
The main app sets up a default NUOPC Field dictionary first and outputs
it to the log files in both traditional and YAML format. Subsequently,
it replaces the default NUOPC Field dictionary with a custom one by
reading its content from a YAML file. The dictionary is then written 
again to the log files as in the previous case.

NOTE: Reading a custom NUOPC Field dictionary from a YAML file requires
building ESMF with support for the third-party library yaml-cpp 
(https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp). See the ESMF User Guide for details.

Description:

  A single model component driven by a single driver component.

  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to drive the MODEL
  component.
  
  No connector components are present.
  
  The MODEL component uses a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files including the content of both the default and custom
    NUOPC Field dictionary, as well as compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - model.F90   - The MODEL component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - driver.F90  - Driver specializing NUOPC_Driver, driving the single MODEL.
  - util.F90    - Module containing utility to log the NUOPC Field dictionary.
  - mainApp.F90 - Main application.

Additional files:
  - fd.yaml     - custom NUOPC Field dictionary file (YAML format)
