README for ATM-OCN with Field Dictionary Synonyms NUOPC prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Show how the NUOPC_FieldDictionarySetSyno() method is used to define 
synonymous StandardNames in the NUOPC Field Dictionary. Here the ATM and OCN
components use a different StandardName for the sea surface temperature,
but the driver defines them as synonyms in the Field Dictionary.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver and two model components.

  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN components. 
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  Both ATM and OCN components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Adding an entry to the field dictionary and
                  setting a dictionary synonym.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
