README for ATM-OCN with transferred LocStream between ATM and OCN Components
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Show how LocStreams can be trasferred in memory between components. The OCN 
component provides LocStreams that the ATM component accepts during 
initialization.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM) and two model components
  (ATM, OCN).
  
  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the two
  model components.

  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN components. 
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  The ESMF driver modifies the CplList attribute on the connectors after they
  have been auto-generated in order to specify custom regridding options.
  
  The OCN component uses a simple two-phase initialization, consisting of 
  advertise and realize.
  
  The ATM component uses a four-phase initialization, consisting of advertise,
  receive-DistGrid, accept-LocStream, realize
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  * Implements IPDv03 to accept LocStreams from OCN component.
                  * Indicates "cannot provide" for LocStream on export Field "pmsl".
                  * Indicates "can provide" for LocStream on import Field "sst".
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
                  * Implements IPDv01.
                  * Implicitly indicate "will provide" for LocStreams on all import
                    and export Fields.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for ATM
                  and OCN.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
