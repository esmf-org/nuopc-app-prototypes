README for ATM-OCN-CplList NUOPC prototype
------------------------------------------

Show how a Driver can modify the CplList on the Connectors to specify 
custom regridding options.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM) and two model components
  (ATM, OCN).
  
  The ESMF driver modifies the CplList attribute on the connectors after they
  have been auto-generated in order to specify custom regridding options.
  
  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the two
  model components.

  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN components. 
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  Both ATM and OCN components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Sets an internal initialization method:
                  ModifyCplLists() to modify the CplList of the Connectors.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
