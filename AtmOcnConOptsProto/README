README for ATM-OCN Connector Options NUOPC prototype
----------------------------------------------------

A two model system with runtime configuration for connector options.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver, two model components, and
  connectors.

  The ESM driver component uses the run sequence configured in the
  [runconfig] file.
  
  The connector components are automatically added by the driver unless
  AUTOCONNECTORS is disabled in esm.F90.
  
  Both ATM and OCN components initialize import data fields to 999999.
  Export data is initialized based on the field.  

  Run success is determined by the zeroValues and missingValues found in
  the final import state. Set zeroValues and missingValues in the
  [runconfig] file as needed.

  For example:
    zeroregion=select, this setting results in missing values
    extrapmethod=nearest_stod, this setting results in no missing/zero values

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp [runconfig]
      where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4
      and [runconfig] is the configuration file, which defaults to
      bilinear.cfg if no command line argument is provided.
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile         - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90          - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90          - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90          - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing
                       generic NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90       - ESM application.

Runtime configuraiton files:
  - bilinear.cfg         - Bilinear regridding with zero values used to fill
                           unmapped points.
  - bilinear_nearest.cfg - Bilinear regridding with nearest neighbor
                           extrapolation used to fill unmapped points.
  - bilinear_select.cfg  - Bilinear regridding with zeroregion=select used to
                           ignore unmapped points resulting in missing value
                           in unmapped points.
