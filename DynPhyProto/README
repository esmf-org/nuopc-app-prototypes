README for DYN-PHY NUOPC prototype
----------------------------------

Show field reference sharing between two components.

Description:

  A one-way coupled system with a single driver and two model components.

  The ATM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between DYN and PHY components. 
  
  The connector component, PHY to DYN, is explicitly added by the driver.
  
  Both DYN and PHY components use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize.
  
  Both DYN and PHY components set SharePolicyField="share" when adverising
  the field with StandardName="PHYEX". This instructs the NUOP_Connector to
  evaluate the possibility to implement the connection via reference sharing
  for this field.
  
  The DYN component uses the default TransferOfferField setting of 
  "will provide" during Advertise (by not specifying it). The PHY component
  explicitly sets TransferOfferField="can provide".
  
  Since both DYN and PHY components inidcate their willingness to share the
  Field allocation via SharePolicyField="share", _and_ both components run on
  the same petList, the Connector is able to set the ShareStatusField="shared"
  (on both sides). Further, the Connector sets TransferActionField="provide"
  on the DYN side (which indicated "will provide"), and 
  TransferActionField="accept" on the PHY side (which indicated just 
  "can provide").
  
  The DYN component realizes in the standard way using NUOPC_Realize() for
  convenience, with selection="realize_connected_remove_others". The PHY
  component on the other hand must consider the TransferActionField="accept"
  setting. Fields that have TransferActionField="accept" are realized 
  automatically by the Connector using the data allocation specified by the
  provider side (here DYN component). Fields can still be modified if needed,
  but in most cases are fine the way they are. To simplify different treatment
  depending on the TransferActionField setting, the NUOPC_Realize() provides
  selection="realize_connected+provide_remove_others". This indicates that 
  only fields that are connected _and_ have TransferActionField="provide", 
  should be realized. Fields that have TransferActionField="accept" are left
  untouched.

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - dyn.F90     - The DYN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - phy.F90     - The PHY component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
