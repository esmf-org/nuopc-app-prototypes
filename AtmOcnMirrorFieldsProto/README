README for ATM-OCN with field mirroring NUOPC prototype
-------------------------------------------------------

A simple two model system, where one Model component requests field mirroring
on one of its States.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM) and two model components
  (ATM, OCN).

  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the two
  model components.
  
  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN components. 
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  The OCN component use a simple two-phase initialization, consisting of
  advertise and realize.
  
  The ATM component uses a three-phase initialization, consisting of 
  advertise/request-mirror, modify mirror-advertised fields, realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for ATM and OCN.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
