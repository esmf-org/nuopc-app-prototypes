README for Nesting NUOPC prototype with a single nestling
---------------------------------------------------------

Show how a driver component uses the "NestingGeneration" and "Nestling" 
attributes to drive two instances of the same model component, where one
instance is a nested domain within the other.

Description:

  A one-way coupled system with a single driver, and two instances of the same
  model component, one being a nestling within the other.

  The driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between the two nest domains.
  
  The connector component from parent domain to nest domain is explicitly added
  by the driver.
  
  The model component uses a simple two-phase initialization, consisting of
  advertise and realize.
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./mainApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile            - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk 
                          mechanism.
  - advectDiffComp.F90  - Advection-Diffusion model that is nested, 
                          specializing the generic NUOPC_Model.
  - driverComp.F90      - Driver component that sets up nesting, 
                          specializing generic the generic NUOPC_Driver.
  - mainApp.F90         - Main application.
