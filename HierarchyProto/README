README for Hierarchy NUOPC prototype
------------------------------------

Show a component hierarchy for an ATM-OCN coupled system, where the ATM
component is implemented as a driver over DYN-PHY coupling.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with two driver levels. The first level ESM driver
  is responsible for the interaction between two model component ATM and OCN.
  On the second level, ATM  is implemented as a driver itself, driving again
  two model components: DYN and PHY.

  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding ATM and OCN.

  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN
  
  The connector components between ATM and OCN are explicitly added by ESM.
  
  The ATM driver component adds the DYN and PHY components as its child
  components. It also explicitly adds a connector component from PHY to DYN.
  
  The ATM driver component uses the default run sequence to drive its child
  components.

  All model components, DYN, PHY, OCN, use a simple two-phase initialization,
  consisting of advertise and realize. 
  

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X > 2 is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - esmApp.F90  - Main application.
  - esm.F90     - Main driver, specializing generic NUOPC_Driver, ATM+OCN as
                  child component.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Driver, DYN+PHY
                  as child components
  - dyn.F90     - The DYN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - phy.F90     - The PHY component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
